# Hangman-Game

Game created on the basis of the third episode of Miros≈Çaw Zelent's Javascript course. A few changes have been made to the version obtained during the lectur - added boundary conditions, imported json file (with the use of fetch method) with keywords to be drawn, restart game screen and player's moves block after the game is over (either won or lost).
